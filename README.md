## What is a code kata?

The idea behind code katas is taken from the martial arts practice of repeating a series of movements until they are second nature. Applying this to coding, it involves focussing on how you solve a problem rather than the actual solution, often repeating the exercise over and over until you don’t even have to think about it.

The exercise can be anything really, but simple scenarios with some emergent complexity work quite well. That way you can start quickly and iterate over the rest of the problem. Often these katas are carried out with some form of constraint, to focus you on a specific technique or just move you outside of your comfort zone to increase your learning.

Most developers never actually practice how to code—they spend all their time focussing on features and make changes the way they always have, as they don’t want to slow down their delivery by investigating a better way to make their change. But it is a good idea to dedicate a little time every week to practicing to make outselves faster and safer.

It might be a good idea to think about katas separately to code design workshops, which aim to improve our design skills rather than our refactoring skills, although there is of course a bit of overlap.

## How to use this project

Each directory in this project should represent a specific kata, with a README.md file describing the exercise. You might like to list a number of interesting constraints that could be applied in the description.
