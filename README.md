## What is a code kata?

The idea behind code katas is taken from the martial arts practice of repeating a series of movements until they are second nature. Applying this to coding, it involves focussing on how you solve a problem rather than the actual solution, often repeating the exercise over and over until you don’t even have to think about it.

The exercise can be anything really, but simple scenarios with some emergent complexity work quite well. That way you can start quickly and iterate over the rest of the problem. Often these katas are carried out with some form of constraint, to focus you on a specific technique or just move you outside of your comfort zone to increase your learning.

Most developers never actually practice how to code—they spend all their time focussing on features and make changes the way they always have, as they don’t want to slow down their delivery by investigating a better way to make their change. But it is a good idea to dedicate a little time every week to practicing to make outselves faster and safer.

It might be a good idea to think about katas separately to code design workshops, which aim to improve our design skills rather than our refactoring skills, although there is of course a bit of overlap.

## How to use this project

Each directory in this project should represent a specific kata, with a README.md file describing the exercise. You might like to list a number of interesting constraints that could be applied in the description.

## Tips for planning a kata
* Explain every step of setup, don't assume people will alaways know what to do
* Ensure you have test ran the setup of any code that needs to be checked out in windows, osx, eclipse and intelliJ
* Prepare early
* You don't need to have all the answers, but having a try at a solution will give you some answers
* Explain the goals of the kata. For example, better understanding of the Open/Closed Principle

## Constraints

Here are some examples of constraints you might like to use, borrowed from http://cromwellhaus.com/2012/01/code-kata-constraints/ and http://www.agilestaffordshire.org/agile/january-2014-kata-with-constraints/

* No mouse
* Only use IDE refactoring
* Code Golf
* No mutable state
* No if statements
* No getters or setters
* Proper TDD (only true refactoring whilst tests pass, making the simplest change to pass etc)
* No IDE
* No changing existing code except to introduce extension points (not as in inheritence)
