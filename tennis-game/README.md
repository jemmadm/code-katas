## Tennis Game Kata

### Summary
This Kata is all about finding creative ways to solve problems. The problem is a fairly simple one: implementing the rules of Tennis scoring and finding a way to print out the appropriate score. A basic TennisGame class has been provided as well as a set of tests that should ensure your scoring is correct.

### Tennis Rules
Our Kata only simulates a single set of Tennis and should end when either player wins that set. When a player wins a point, different terms are used to refer to the current score.
* No points won is described as "Love"
* The first point won is "15"
* The second point won is "30"
* The third point won is "40"
* The fourth point can may be called "Game" - if that player won

That is all straightforward, but wait - there's more! If you've ever watched professional Tennis you might have seen that sets can go on for ages. This is because a player can only win if they score two points above their opponent. This changes the scoring somewhat and the terminology used. If two players have a tied score of 40 - 40 then those scores are referred to as "Deuce". The score of player that wins the next point is then referred to as "Advantage" and their opponents becomes "Disadvantage". If a player wins when they are at Advantage then they win that set - if not then the score returns to Deuce. 

### What's Been provided
The project provided includes the TennisGame & TennisGameTest classes as well as three game files that hold the match data for the tests. These are just text files with 1's & 2's that describe who wins each point. You shouldnâ€™t need to do anything to load these in, this has been provided.

### Your Task
You need to work out how to determine if a game has been won and who has won it. You also need to determine if a draw has been reached - this has arbitrarily been set to 50 points. If a player wins the winner String should be set to either "Player One" or "Player Two" and if neither player has won before 50 points have been played then it should be set to "Draw" and the game ended. This should be done in the gameWon() method.

You also need to provide a print out of the current score in the printScores() method. This is called after each point is played. Remember that 1 - 1 is not a correct Tennis score. Your printout would need to say '15 - 15' or 'Deuce - Deuce', for example. The correct textual values to output have been described in the Tennis Rules section, if you are unfamiliar with Tennis scoring.

### Rules/Restrictions
There are few rules on this Kata - the goal is for you to play around with the code and find whatever creative solution you can to the problem. You may add as many new classes/fields/methods as you wish. You cannot edit the tests or the test game files, though if you feel extra tests or test games would be beneficial then you can write your own.

### Tips/Advice
* Tennis scoring can be trickier than you first think but knowing the number of points played and how many points each player has won is enough to establish the score at any given point.
* When swapping pairs, try to tackle the problem in a completely different way. The goal isn't to complete the Kata, it's to find the many ways that you could complete it.
* Play around with the code. You don't need to ensure you are always green in this Kata - it's okay to fail!
