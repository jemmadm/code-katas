## Problem Description

Create a game which allows you to ask twenty questions about an object randomly selected from a pre-set list of objects with the objective that you guess what the object is.

The player should be prompted with a list of questions that they can ask, and then when they have selected the question, what the answer is.

After each question they should have the option to guess what the object is, in which case they get no more questions, or ask another question. Once they have asked twenty questions they must guess and the game is over.

If you want to extend the game, consider keeping a scoreboard.

## Suggested constraints
