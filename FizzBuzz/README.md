# FizzBuzz Game Code Kata

## The Open/Closed Principle

*“software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification”*

ie.
change an entity's behaviour without altering its source code.

## The FizzBuzz Game

### The Rules

Print “Fizz!” for multiples of 3<br />
Print “Buzz!” for multiples of 5<br />
Print “FizzBuzz!” for multiples of both 3 and 5<br />
Print the number if none of the above.<br />

For example:<br />
*“1, 2, Fizz!, 4, Buzz!, Fizz!, 7, 8, Fizz!, Buzz!, 11, Fizz!, 13, 14, FizzBuzz!, 16,...”*
